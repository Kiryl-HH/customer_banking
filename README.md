# Customer Banking System

### I built a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

* The user is prompted to set the savings balance, interest rate, and months for the savings account.
* Code is written to print out the interest earned and updated savings account balance with interest earned for the given months. The values are formatted to two decimal places and thousandths.
